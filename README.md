# Heart Disease Prediction System Using Machine Learning


The objective of this project is to predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms. The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing and 2 classification models using scikit-learn: Logistic Regression, and  Support Vector Classifier Model to investigate their performance on heart disease datasets obtained from the UCI data repository. 
I've used two different Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.
